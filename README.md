# EngComp - Assignment 1
This was my solution to my first major assignment for COMP20005 - Engineering Computation at UniMelb in Semester 1 2016. This was my first ever C program, I really loved this course, and I really love C so I'm a fairly fond of both this and [the second assignment](https://github.com/Rogimus/EngComp---Assignment-2). I lost the Spec unfortunately, and the code is rather specific and uninteresting, so instead I'll just say that this code was an introduction to some really basic software engineering - the code takes a formatted text file, runs some calculations on the data, and presents it nicely in a table in the terminal. In this case the data was presented as floor plans for appartments.

**N.B** `ass1format2.c` is the code you should run, and the code I handed in. Clearly I don't like deleting rubbish attempts at code, but the other `.c` files are there if anyone is curious what my little 1st year brain was trying to do for a very simple project. I'm happy to say that I commented much more in my final version of this assignment than for assignment 2 - too bad this code was so simple it didn't call for any good expositional commenting.
